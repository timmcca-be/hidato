# Parallelizing Hidato

This project aims to parallelize the search for and scoring of solutions for Hidato, a logic puzzle game.

## Building and Running

The code must be executed on a computer with a [CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).

First, install the [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) from NVIDIA. Then, clone this repository and run `make` from the root directory.
The executable will be built to `build/hidato`.
